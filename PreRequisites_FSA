PreRequisites 
Symbol : a,b,c ,0,1,2,3
Aplhabet : collection of the symbols denoted by sigma 
String : sequence of the symbols is the string basically .
Lnaguage :set of string is called as the language . 

Some of the language defined over -> 0,1:
L1-> set of all teh string of the length 2 -> 00,01,10,11 .
L2-> Set of all the string of length 3 -> 000,001,010,011......
Here the l1 and l2 are the language defined over the aplhabet 0,1 .


The language set of the output can be a infinite set as well , 2^(infinity) -> uncountbale set . The is infinitly countale . 

Some of the defined set can be uncountably infinite alos that majorly depend on the input taken,.  

Powers of sigma :
aplhabet ->0,1
sigma^0: set of all the string of length 0 : null set 
sigma1: set of all the string of the length 1 &0 : 0,1 ,null 
sigma2 : set of the all the stirng with 2 
This goes so on upto the required length : 
..

Cardinality of the powered sigma :
NUMBER Of the element in the set recived after the po0wer generated . 
Card n :  2^n number of the total elements .

sigma star  :
this is the union of the power of the sigma powers :
all the union of the set of the sgman power is the sigma star bascially the universal set  .
