Moore and Mealy model State Machines 
Moore state machines :
Mealy state machines :

The difference in the two circuit is the way the output is generated.
The output generation of the twop machines sometimes does not depend on the input taken and this is called Moore state machines . 

In the moore state machines , the function output is the the function of the input state only . 

The output of the moore state depend only on the state of the machine .


Mealy state machines : The out put of this machine depend on the present state of the machine and also on th input as well . 
The output function is : input funvtion + state machine  function 


Next state decoder is a important logic diagram used to show what will be the combinational output . 


Inside the present state the state of the machine is stored and hence the output is depened on the present state of the machine . The next state decoder is specifically the moore state finite machine .

Mealy State machines :
The output is the function of the present state and the the inputy state  .
The major change in this is that the output diagram or the next state decordee has a extra ouput from the input to the memedory and is used to stroe the present state and the present output . 


The  mealy and the moore state machines are interconvertiable so they can be cross converted from  each other .
In this sequernce and the pattern detector is used specially for the pattern finding to find out either the machines is a moore or a mrealy state machines .
